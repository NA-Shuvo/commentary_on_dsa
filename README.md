# Commentary on Data Structures and Algorithms
 

> If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it. - Toni Morrison  

> Write what should not be forgotten - Isabel Allende

This text is a compilation of (and my personal commentary on) useful materials on Data Structures and Algorithms. The purpose of this compilation is primarily to jot down techniques, ideas and implementations of Algorithms and Data Structures. I will try to attach related contexts and history; links to useful materials as well as public research projects available on the web. Moreover, I will include materials for competetive programming and link to my accepted solutions for some problem. Also without any hesitation and permission I will link to other's public solution regarding them as useful techniques. Therefore, this document is not exclusive either for researchers or for competetive programmers. Though tough to catagorize it, curious readers, I hope, will find it useful and can use as a commentary or summary or summary commentary! No detailed discussion will be found here. And the secondary purpose is to get myself swiftly immersed in technical writing.  
  
> I would not write this note but I am motivated as an instructor by [Jeff Erickson][1]. He strongly encouraged the instructors to write materials on their own. Any deficiencies in this document is my fault and I don't care. But I created an issue tracker. And you know why and how an issue tracker is used. Please report bug, give suggestions and general feedback here.  

You can email me @ <nasim.a.shuvo.cuet13@gmail.com>. I am a very little man and I read all mails and if possible try to reply.  

One last thing, I will update this page with new entries of the commentaries in the [entry stack](#es) bellow with a **new** flag. So, you can easily find the entries. But if you want to get a notification, just fill [this][] in. You will be notified via mail.

Thank you!
