# Essential Problems
This file contains some essential problems for individuals who want to foster minimum working skill in computer programming (of course in any programming language).
However, I must encourage to solve problem in online judges. Practicing in online judges helps with providing more sound problems as well as it confirms the quality of solutions.

## Basic IO
*  Print your name using the most basic output function of your favorite language.
*  Take an integer input.
*  Take two integers input.
*  Take one integer, two characters and then again two integers.
*  First, take one integer, two characters and then again two integers as inputs and then print each of the input in new lines.
*  Take ten(10) integers.
*  Take ten different types of data and print them as follows: first five data will be printed as they are separated by a comma(,) and next each of five data will be printed in a new line.

## Loops
### Single Loop Integer Problems
*  Print all numbers in $[1\ 100]$. First print them in ascending order and then print them in discending order.
*  Print the factorial of a given number, eg. 8!
*  Given an integer $n$, find the number of digits.
*  Find the maximum and minimum number in a given array. (Array)
*  Given an integer $n$, print the digits in MSB to LSB order.(Array)
*  Print the sum of the series $9 + 99 + 999+ \cdots$ upto given $n$ terms.
*  Check whether a given integer is PERFECT or NOT.
*  Determine whether a given number is PRIME or NOT.
*  List all the prime numbers within a given range of numbers.(Array + Brute Force || Sieve of Eratosthenes)
*  Display the first n terms of Fibonacci series.
*  Conversion of between number systems (Array):
   *  Decimal to binary
   *  Binary to decimal
   *  Decimal to octal
   *  Octal to binary
### Single Loop Real Number Problems
*  Find the sum of the series $1 - \frac{x^{2}}{2!} + \frac{x^{4}}{4!} - \cdots$ up to given number of terms for a given value of x.
*  Find the value of sin(x) for given x.
*  Find the value of cos(x) for give x.
*  Given an integer $n$, print the sum of [Harmonic series](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HarmonicSeries.html) $H_{n}$.
