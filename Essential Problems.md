# Essential Problems
This file contains some essential problems for individuals who want to foster minimum working skill in computer programming (of course in any programming language).
However, I must encourage to solve problem in online judges. Practicing in online judges helps with providing more sound problems as well as it confirms the quality of solutions.  

## Quick Jump
*  [Basic I/O](#basic-io)
*  [Loops](#loops)

## Basic IO
*  Print your name using the most basic output function of your favorite language.
*  Take an integer input.
*  Take two integers input.
*  Take one integer, two characters and then again two integers.
*  First, take one integer, two characters and then again two integers as inputs and then print each of the input in new lines.
*  Take ten(10) integers.
*  Take ten different types of data and print them as follows: first five data will be printed as they are separated by a comma(,) and next each of five data will be printed in a new line.

## Loops
*  Print your name ten(10) times, each of them in a different line.
*  Print all numbers in $[1\ 100]$. First print them in ascending order and then print them in discending order.
*  Find the maximum and minimum number in a given array.
